I work as a Senior Data Scientist in an Ad Optimization team of a DSP (Demand-Side Platform) company. I hold a PhD degree in computational neuroimaging.  

I have contributed to several industry-level projects that enhanced the campaign performance using techniques such as optimization, machine learning, RNN, non-parametric modeling, control theory, data engineering, and programmatic advertising domain knowledge. Among the various projects I have worked on, the most impactful one helped the business reduce COGS by at least 10%.

During my phd, I developed a data resource package for [human brain atlas](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/iit/) that functions like the Google Maps for the brain. The coolest thing about this package is that it provides you a list of probalities that inform you about the strength of the connections between gray matter regions in your brainâ€™s white matter.
